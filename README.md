# Frontend Code Challenge

> ### It was a live code challenge I faced, I created two pages, one to display a list of 10 GitHub users as cards, the second to display specific user information 


## Built With

- HTML - HTML5
- CSS - CSS3
- JavaScript - ES6

## Additional Used

- [Endpints Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/users#list-users) 

## Live Demo

[Live Demo](https://github-users-navy.vercel.app/)

## Objectives & What I learned

- How Can I work with or benefit from `query string`?
- How can I get query string values from url in JavaScript?
- Fully Responsive design without any `media queries` 


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Bondok6/github-users
```

```bash
cd github-users
```
